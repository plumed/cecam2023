# PLUMED school 2023 application notes

We are delighted to announce that we have received funding from CECAM to run a PLUMED workshop and user day in Lausanne on the following dates:

Monday July 3rd - Thursday 6th July 2023

You can find more information about the event on the [CECAM website](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1200)

The masterclass series we ran in 2021 and 2022 showed us that it is possible to run the lectures and workshops that we would have done in previous PLUMED meetings online.  You can now learn what was taught in previous iterations of the tutorial from resources that we have provided for free online.   Given how easily available this information is and the expense associated with bringing everyone to one place we felt it would be wrong to run the meeting as a series of talks and workshops.  Instead the focus of the two day tutorial part will be working with other students and with us to complete mini, group-work projects using PLUMED.  

We have funding to pay for accommodation for 25 students to participate in this event, which we will allocate based on the strength of your application.  A strong application is one that provides evidence that you have engaged with the masterclasses on [this website](https://www.plumed.org/masterclass).  Try to be specific in your evidence by talking about what you learned by completing these exercises.  Describe how you plan to use the techniques you learned by completing these exercises to complete the research projects that you are currently working on.  Ideally we would like the students who are attending the workshop to have completed all of the masterclasses in the 21 series.  An application that does not mention that you have attempted some of the masterclasses will be looked on very poorly.  Notice, furthermore, that you should be able to edit any applications that have already been made through the CECAM website so as to include the evidence that you have engaged with the masterclasses.

The two day tutorial will be followed by a two day user meeting on the 5th and 6th July.  This user meeting will take place in a hybrid format and will involve four, 3 hour chaired discussions about the following topics:

* Data driven sampling
* Kinetics
* Enhanced sampling for materials science
* Enhanced sampling for biochemistry

Anyone can attend these discussions either online or in person.  However, we have no funding to pay accommodation for people attending the discussion in person.  If you feel you have something useful to contribute to one of these discussions based on your recent work or your opinions you can let the chair know during the meeting.  Alternatively, before the meeting, you can use the CECAM website to let us know that you want to present during one of the sessions.  Letting us know beforehand that you have material to present will help us to organize the discussion.  If you feel that slides would help you present your point you can also prepare one or two slides.  As with the tutorial, however, we are trying to do something that is different from the traditional academic conference.  We hope that there will be a lively discussion about the challenges and the state of the art in each of the topics we have picked for discussion. In previous iterations of the PLUMED meeting shorter discussions have enabled us to better shape the development of PLUMED so we are excited to see what comes out from a longer discussion.

We look forward to seeing you all in July
